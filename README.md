# Text-Editor

## Description
This project was created to demonstrate my ability to use and understand PWA's(Progressive Web Apps). Using technologies such as webpack, IndexedDb, inject manifest, JavaScript, service workers, and node, you will be able to create and use a simple text editor. You are also able to install the app. Using local storage and IndexedDb, you are able to navigate this app offline. 
This project was created to demonstrate my ability to use the MVC model. Using technologies such as Sequelize, Handlebars, Express, Dotenv and others, you will be able to navigate a Tech Blog with articles and comments that relate to interesting points of views and discussions. Create a user, add posts, comment on other posts, and follow the world of Web Development in a easy to use and simple process. Deployed using Heroku, the back end will store all information in a mySQL database.
